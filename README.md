# AI learning how to play games

I tryied to program a computer learn how to play the game snake by itself for my end of high school project.

## Concept

This project was my first try about programming artifical intellignence using neural networks. I did it when I was 16-17 years old in the as part of a project I needed to do in the end of high school. I finished the whole thing in about 6 months (in parallel to school).

I was inpiered by two videos I saw from the YouTuber [CodeBullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q). He was doing very interesting things using artificial intelligence and I wanted to do the same.

There are two programs both written in python:

1. The first one is called Dots_AI and it is a program where dots learn how to overcome an obstacle on their path to a goal. If they touch the obstacle they die. They were trying to reach a goal located behind the obstacle the fastest way possible. I used genitic algorythm and natural selection in order to get the dots to improve themselfs.

2. The second program is called Snake_AI and it is a program where the computer learns how to play the game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). I needed to recreate the game in the first place in order to let an AI play it as it was controlling my keyboard. I used neaural networks and a more advanced genetic algorythm than in my first program in order get the snake to achieve a good score.

During my work, I also learned how to code in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) in order to document my project. It is written all in french because I was in a french speaking school. (Sorry for the occasional typos.

## Files

There are multiples files in this repo and they all can not just be executed and work like on their own. They are here just to explain how everything was done.

This is what each file stands for:

* _Annexe1-TM_Jung_Lucas_3M6.tex_ is my LaTeX file and it was used to create the final pdf of my project document
* _Annexe2-Dots-ai_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is the first program that I was talking about in the [ยง Concept](#concept)
* _Annexe3-Snake-game_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is my own version of the snake game
* _Annexe4-Snake-ai_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is the second program that I was tlaking about in the [ยง Concept](#concept)
* _Annexe5-Snake-replay_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is a program that I wrote in order to be able to watch the games that the computer was performing over again.
* _TM_Jung_Lucas_3M6.pdf_ is my final document explaining my project that I presented to my teachers.

There is also a _demo_ folder where are stored some videos of my programs:

* _dot_ai.mp4_ is a video showing my first program running. We can see that population after population, the dots are imporving at reaching the goal faster.
* _snake_81.mp4_ is a video showing a game of the computer playing snake and reaching a score of 81 fruits.
* _snake_ai_beginning.mp4_ is a video showing how fast the computer learns how to play the game from knowing nothing to have a decent understanding.
* _snake_ai_mess.mp4_ is a video showing the "back stages" of what is really going on: multiple games are runing at the smae time and this aloows the computer to learn faster.
* _snake_game.mp4_ is a video of me playing my own version of snake.

## Conclusion

Once I finished my programs and writing the document, I did an oral presentation to my teacher and an exepret in the pesence of a public. I finished with the highest grade so I was really happy about it. I learned a lot about AI and neural networks by doing this project and I am very proud of it.
