# AI learning how to play games

I programmed a computer to learn how to play the game snake by itself for my end of high school project.

## Concept

This project was my first try in programming artifical intellignence using neural networks. I did it when I was 16 (finished at 17) years old as part of a project I needed to do at the end of high school. I finished the whole thing in about 6 months (while being in school).

I was inspiered by two videos I saw from the YouTuber [CodeBullet](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q). He was doing very interesting things using artificial intelligence and I wanted to do the same.

There are two programs, both written in python:

1. The first one is called Dots_AI and it is a program where dots learn how to overcome an obstacle on their path to a goal. If they touch the obstacle they die. Their goal was to reach a point located behind an obstacle the fastest way possible. I used genitic algorythm and natural selection in order to get the dots to improve themselves.

2. The second program is called Snake_AI and it is a program where the computer learns how to play the game [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)). I needed to recreate the game in the first place in order for an AI to play it by emulating the control of my keyboard. I used neaural networks and a more advanced genetic algorythm than in my first program in order get the snake to achieve a good score.

During my work, I also learned how to code in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) in order to document my project. It is written all in french because I was in a french speaking school. (Sorry for the occasional typos)

## Files

There are multiples files in this repository but they cannot all just be executed and work on their own. They are here just to explain how everything was done.

This is what each file stands for:

* _Annexe1-TM_Jung_Lucas_3M6.tex_ is my LaTeX file and it was used to create the final pdf of my project's document
* _Annexe2-Dots-ai_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is the first program that I was talking about in the [ยง Concept](#concept)
* _Annexe3-Snake-game_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is my own version of the snake game
* _Annexe4-Snake-ai_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is the second program that I was tlaking about in the [ยง Concept](#concept)
* _Annexe5-Snake-replay_Jung_Lucas_3M6.py_ is a program that I wrote in order to be able to rewatch the games that the computer was performing
* _TM_Jung_Lucas_3M6.pdf_ is my final document explaining my project that I presented to my teachers.

There is also a _demo_ directory where are stored some videos of my programs:

* _dot_ai.mp4_ is a video showing my first program running. We can see that population after population, the dots are imporving and reaching the goal faster.
* _snake_81.mp4_ is a video showing a game of the computer playing snake and reaching a score of 81 fruits.
* _snake_ai_beginning.mp4_ is a video showing how fast the computer learns how to play the game from knowing nothing to having a decent understanding.
* _snake_ai_mess.mp4_ is a video showing the "back stages" of what is really going on: multiple games are runing at the smae time and this allows the computer to learn faster.
* _snake_game.mp4_ is a video of me playing my own version of snake.

## Conclusion

Once I finished my programs and writing the document, I did an oral presentation in front of my teacher, an exepret and a public. I finished with the highest grade possible so I was really happy about it. I learned a lot about AI and neural networks by doing this project and I am very proud of it.
